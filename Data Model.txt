A course will be a simple interface holding important data about that specific course like name, credits, prerequisites, etc
A semester will be an interface with an array of courses, the total credit count, and the year and season the semester takes place
A degree plan will contain an array of semesters, a title to label the plan, and the specific degree that the plan represents along
    its requirements for completion.

We will add any other attributes to the interfaces as we need them.

courseInterFace: 
    courseName: string 
    numCredits: number
    preReq: string[]
    taken: boolean

semesterInterface: 
    season: string 
    year: number 
    courseList: courseInterface[]
    totalCredits: number

possibly a year interface to group four consecutive semesters of fall, winter, spring, summer

degreePlanInterface:
    semesterList: semesterInterface[]
    title: string
    degree: string
    requiredCourses: courseInterface[]
    requiredCredits: number

This degree plan interface is highly volatile. We will more that likely need to change it as we start to flesh out the project more.
For instance we might want to create a year interface, so then the degree plan will contain an array of years rather than semesters.

An array of all possible courses to choose from
allCourses: courseInterface[]
